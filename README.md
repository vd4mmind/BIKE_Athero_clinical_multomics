# BIKE_Athero
This repository contains analysis scripts for BIKE Atherosclerosis. 

This study is a collaboration of Novo Nordisk A/S and Vascular Surgery department of Karolinska Institute around Biobank of Karolinska Endarterectomies (BiKE) cohort.

## All single omics analysis each under seprate folders
- RNASeq
- Proteomics
- Metabolomics
- Multiomics
- metadata linking across Symptomatic and Asymptomatic phenotype
- Reusing public single cell data for specific cell type of interest and gene of interest to add more context to cell phenotype around findings from bulk single omics and multiomics analysis across tissue and phenotype
